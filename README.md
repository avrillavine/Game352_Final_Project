# Ibalet


The Objective of the Game:

Collect randomly placed dots to increase your score! ~~avoid enemies! Getting touched by an enemy will kill the player and end the game.~~ could not add enemies in due to time as being unable to alter the score

Players interact with the game by tapping and dragging their finger against the screen to direct a triangle towards the target
The target is the circular dot on the screen which disappears upon contact
